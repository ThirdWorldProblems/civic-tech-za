# 🌍 Civic Tech ZA

## 👋 Introduction

This is an exploratory, community-driven project for all those interested in using technology for social good in South Africa. 

The goals of this repository are as follows:

1. **Increase discussion and sharing of ideas amongst those interested in civic technology within South Africa**.

2. **Link those willing to contribute to civic-tech projects to real-world projects that need their specific skills**. 

3. **Provide opportunities and resources for those interested in further developing their specific craft (development, design, journalism, research) or awareness around social/civic issues in South Africa against the backdrop civic technology**. 

## 🔨 Get Involved

### 1. Engagement

#### 📱 Online

This is a project initiated by the community-driven `#civic-tech` _Slack_ discussion channel on ZA Tech.

We strive to keep this an open, inclusive space and would love to have you be part of the South African civic-tech conversation. Those interested in merely observing/lurking are also welcome! :)

#### 📴 Offline

If you are in the Cape Town area, we host community evenings centered around civic-tech projects/discussion (open to everyone, no matter what your skill level or interest in civic-tech) in [Claremont](https://goo.gl/maps/CtGcN7GW93P2). We also provide free beer and pizza!
